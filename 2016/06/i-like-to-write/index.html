  <p>Let me not bury the lede: Samsung is acquiring Joyent, and Scott’s blog entry explains why we feel that this is such a good fit. As Joyent’s CTO, I wanted to offer my perspective and couch this acquisition in its broader historical context: the world’s largest consumer electronics company is acquiring a cloud computing pioneer; what’s going on here?</p>

<p>A decade ago, one probably wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed that the leaders in computing—which at the time included the survivors from the mainframe, minicomputer, workstation and personal computer revolutions—would become a search engine and an online bookstore. In this regard, cloud computing managed to achieve what previous computing revolutions did not: shift the wellspring of innovation away from those who merely design machines towards those who actually use them to solve their own problems. This shift—accelerated (if not outright facilitated) by the rise of open source—has left yesterday&rsquo;s computing leaders displaced and disoriented; not only do they not have the solutions, but at a very real level they don&rsquo;t even understand the problem: these legacy companies have never themselves meaningfully deployed on the cloud and (despite nodding along with cloud computing) they still really struggle to understand why anyone would do it that way.</p>
